        <p>What would you say, write, imagine, draw if you knew no one who would ever see.</p>

        <p>What secrets, guilts, desires, fantasies would you unburden.</p>

        <p>This site provides that opportunity.</p>

        <p>Whatever you put to down on the following page will be put out into the VOID never to be seen again.</p>

        <p>It's up to you now,</p>

        <p>Whether you use this opportunity to unburden yourself or disregard it, the choice is yours.</p>
